## Sunday - April 27th, 2025

- Today is my busy study and coding day where I am trying to accomplish as much difficult learning as possible. Specifically today, I am working on getting Rust down finally so I can have a modern systems programming language and build off of what I'm learning in C - well in [Beej's Guide To C Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgc/), a guide to learning C I couldn't recommend enough for developers.
- I also plan on getting into Data Structures and Algorithms for a bit and then working on System's Design before working on some projects. I have a big project idea that I am planning on building out, partly for fun and partly to see if it works as a good open source project that people are interested in. We'll find out!

## To Do Today

- [ ] Rust Learning
- [ ] C Learning
- [ ] DSA Learning and Practice
- [ ] System Design Learning and Practice
- [ ] Camping Full-Stack Project
