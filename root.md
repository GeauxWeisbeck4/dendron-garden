## Andrew's Dendron Garden

Welcome to my Dendron Garden, a digital garden workspace for taking notes, coding, productivity, and more. It gets annoying switching between Logseq and VS Code at time and I want to be able to take notes in the same window and Dendron allows just that!

I also want to build a similar tool so it will help to use the product while learning the code bases of Dendron, Foam, etc.
